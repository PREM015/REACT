# React Learning Repo

I made this repo because I'm learning React.

Each folder covers a different topic or concept I'm practicing. Code might be messy or incomplete — it's just for learning and experimenting.


## Notes

- Not following any strict tutorial.
- Just building, breaking, and fixing stuff.
- Using **Vite** and **PNPM** for most setups.
- Some folders may have Tailwind or plain CSS depending on what I was trying.

## Purpose

This is not for production or sharing — it's for personal learning only.

That's it.
