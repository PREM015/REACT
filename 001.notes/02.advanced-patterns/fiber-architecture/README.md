# 🧠 React Fiber Architecture

React Fiber is the **new reconciliation engine** in React (from v16+).  
It gives React the power to **pause, resume, split & prioritize** work — making UI updates smoother and smarter.

## ⚡ Why Fiber?

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Interruptible Rendering | UI doesn't freeze during large updates |
| Task Scheduling | React decides what to render first |
| Lazy/Suspense | Supports code splitting easily |
| Better UX | Smooth animations, faster interactivity |

## 🧪 Real-World Analogy

> Fiber is like a **smart waiter** in a busy restaurant — who decides which customer to serve first, without blocking the whole system.

---

## ⚛️ Where is Fiber used?

You already use it when you write:
- `useState`, `useEffect`
- `Suspense`, `lazy`
- Concurrent rendering

---

## 🛠️ Want to See Fiber in Action?

Try creating a slow component with a loop.  
React will handle it better with Fiber — earlier it would freeze the whole app!

---

📌 You don’t use Fiber directly — but React’s performance boost comes from it internally.
